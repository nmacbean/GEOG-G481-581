## In-Class Exercises: 

During the in-class exercises we will learn how to build a simple carbon model. We will also test the sensitivity of the model and use it to answer some fundamental climate and environmental change questions. Finally, we will learn about data assimilation (DA) tools for estimating model uncertainty and optimizing model parameters, and we will analyze the results of some simple DA experiments

Students will learn about the differences between model inputs, parameters, functions, calulations and outputs for a simple 2 pool carbon model.

Four in-class exercises will be set for the practical part of the course.

Students will need to complete the assigned exercises and submit them by the given deadline.

All practical exercises will be completed in Python v3 in a Jupyter Notebook using the IU Carbonate supercomputer on the Research Desktop.
